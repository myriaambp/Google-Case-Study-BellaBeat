# Google-Case-Study-BellaBeat

**This repository contains the final Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course.**

Bellabeat is a high tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. The devices collect data on the user's activity, sleep, stress and reproductive health. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print and television but mainly focuses on digital marketing. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and displays ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.

The co-founder has asked me to analyse smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. An analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth.

* Goal 1: Identify trends in smart device usage.
* Goal 2: Identify how these trends could apply to Bellabeat customers.
* Goal 3: Identify how these trends could help influence Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
