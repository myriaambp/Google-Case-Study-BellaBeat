Introduction </span>\n<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1\"></a>\n\nBellabeat is a high tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products for women. The devices collect data on the user's activity, sleep, stress and reproductive health. The company has invested in traditional advertising  media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print and television but mainly focuses on digital marketing. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and displays ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.\n# <span style=\"color:#FA8072; font-size:16px;\"> 1.1 Products </span>\n<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"1_1\"></a>\nBellabeats products include the following:\nBellabeat app: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress,\nmenstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and\nmake healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.\nLeaf: Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.\nTime: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.\nSpring: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are\nappropriately hydrated throughout the day.

It contains personal fitness trackers from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.\n# <span style=\"color:#FA8072; font-size:16px;\"> 3.2 Accessibility and Privacy</span>\n<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"3_2\"></a>\n*CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication* <br>\nThe individual who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of their trite to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighbouring rights, to the extent allowed by law.

Each file contains quantitative data tracked by the device. Each unique user has data on multiple rows, corresponding to the different dates (total of 31 days per user: 4/12/2016 to 5/9/2016), therefore this data is considered long.

This will be able to provide us with more conclusive and accurate results. Additionally, it would be important to have the demographic of each user, as the fitbit is targeted to both men and women.

Where the more steps a user takes, the more calories they burn. We classified users into 3 categories and saw that the average of users tend to walk relatively less on Sundays than other weekdays. By sending them daily notifications, we can encourage customers to reach a specific number of steps per day. If the user is able to reach this goal every day for a month, a reward such as a discount on the app could be given (as an incentive).|\n|Sleep Tracking Features| Based on the results, it is seen that users track their sleep (41.7%) more than they track their daily steps (21%). Since this seems to be an important feature for users, it is recommended that they implement other features (apart from how many hours a day they sleep) such as their movement, sound and heart rate into the watch. This would allow them to monitor their sleep more efficiently.|\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
